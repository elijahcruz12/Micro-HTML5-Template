### About

Micro is a web template created by @elijahcruz12 as a simple template to create your own website.

Micro is written WITHOUT JavaScript, meaning it can work on most web browsers.

This theme completely responsive, and was built using a flexbox style grid. This means it makes use of classes like .row, .col-xs, col-lg-8, etc. If you have experience with css frameworks such as ECKit or Bootstrap, you should be able to edit the theme easily.

This theme also uses reset.css by ECWebServices (license MIT) to ensure that the theme looks the same through all browsers.
